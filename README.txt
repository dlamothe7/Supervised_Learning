I have uploaded all of my code

My two datasets are included as .csv's titled titanic.csv and wheat-seeds.csv

The code I ran to do analysis for each algorithm is in a .py file of the same name. 

The SupervisedLearningUtils.py file is where I imported and formatted the data so it could be used by the algorithms.
There are also a few funcitons in there that are used between multiple algorithms. 

I have also included extra figures for reference that did not make it onto the report, they will be in the
